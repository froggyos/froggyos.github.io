# froggyOS Documentation
FroggyOS is a CLI-based programming operating system that is designed to be simple and easy to use. It is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It was created to be a fun and educational way to introduce beginners to CLI-based operating systems, as opposed to GUI-based operating systems, like Windows.
## General Information
* in paths, `.` will be replaced with the current directory
* programs can *only* be written in designated directories
* you can press the `DEL` key to escape programs (ex. an infinite loop)
* if a FroggyScript program exits with an error, the command `[[BULLFROG]]gotoprogramline [program] [line with error]` will be put into your command history
* file types are inferred based on file location
* For whatever reason, if there is no typeable line in the terminal, press `SHIFT + ENTER` to create a typeable line
### Paths
Paths have three parts, the drive, the directory, and the file name.
```
┌───────────Full Path──────────┐
├─────Location─────┐           │
[drive]:/[directory]/[file name]
```
## Aliases
* changelanguage -> lang
* clear -> cl
* clearstate -> cls
* croak -> c
* formattime -> ft
* hatch -> ch
* help -> ?
* hop -> h
* list -> ls
* listdrives -> ld
* loadstate -> lds
* macro -> /
* meta -> m
* metaprop -> mp
* opendocumentation -> docs
* savestate -> svs
* spawn -> s
* swimto -> st

## File Types
There are no defined file types in froggyOS. Instead, file types are determined by the location of the file.
- `D:/Programs` - executable programs
    - edit the `allowedProgramDirectories` key in the user file to allow more directories to hold programs
- `D:/Macros` - macro files
- `D:/Palettes` - color palette files
- `D:/Spinners` - spinner files
- `Config:/langs` - language files

## Translating froggyOS into Different Languages
* The `lbh` file in the `Config:/langs` directory is what holds the indexes for translation. **Do not edit this file unless you deliberately want to mess up froggyOS.**
    * Languages file names are 3 letter abbreviations of the language name.
* To add a new language, clone the `lbh`, or `language build helper` file, which contains **translation descriptors** (prefixed with `T_`), which give you an idea of what the intended meaning of the text.
* Set the language to `lbh` to see which translation descriptors are used where in froggyOS. If there are missing translation descriptors at the end of a file, the English translation will be used.
    * If a language file does not meet requirements (valid name declaration, correct file length), it will be invalid and unable to be used.
* The **name declaration** must be the first line of the file, and must be in the format `!LANGNAME: [language name]`. For example, the name declaration for the `eng` file is `!LANGNAME: English`.
* If the default language is invalid, froggyOS will automatically revert to the `lbh` language file.
* If a text results in `Index Missing! -> [translation descriptor]`, this means that the translation descriptor is missing from the language file.
* Some translation descriptors include `{{}}` in it. These are called **inclusions**. Inclusions allow translations to include dynamic text. For example, if you used `T_greeting_2 {{3 million}}`, it would return in the `eng` translation as `* Welcome to froggyOS, version 3 million *`. You can use as many inclusions as you want. You can also use multiple inclusions in a single translation descriptor, as long as the descriptor can handle that amount of inclusions.

## Command Help
### formattime
The all instances of the following characters (or character sequences) will be replaced with their respective values. Place a `!` before the character to escape it.
#### Date
* weekday
    * `w` - short weekday (Mon, Tues)
    * `W` - long weekday (Monday, Tuesday)
* `y` - year
* month
    * `mn` - month number (01, 02)
    * `mnu` - month number unpadded (1, 2)
    * `ms` - month short (Jan, Feb)
    * `M` - month long (January, February)
* day
    * `d` - day (01, 02)
    * `du` - day unpadded (1, 2)
    * `D` - ordinal day (1st, 2nd) (English only)

#### Time
* hour
    * `h` - 24 hour (00, 01, ... 22, 23)
    * `hu` - 24 hour unpadded (0, 1, ... 22, 23)
    * `H` - 12 hour (01, 02, ... 11, 12)
    * `Hu` - 12 hour unpadded (1, 2, ... 11, 12)
* minute
    * `m` - minute (00, 01)
    * `mu` - minute unpadded (0, 1)
* second
    * `s` - second (00, 01)
    * `su` - second unpadded (0, 1)
* millisecond
    * `l` - millisecond (000, 001)
    * `lu` - millisecond unpadded (0, 1)
* `a` - AM/PM
* `z` - timezone

### hop
* `hop ~` will take you to the root directory of the current drive
* `hop -` will take you to the previous directory

### metaprop
Properties:
* read - If this file can be read. This includes being able to run the program or list file contents with the `spy` command.
    * when a file is cloned, this property will be set to `true`.
* write - If this file can be written to. This includes being able to edit the file or delete it.
    * when a file is cloned, this property will be set to `true`.
* hidden - If this file is hidden. This will prevent the file from being acted upon (for example, it cannot be edited).
* transparent - This file will not show in the directory or in lists, but can be acted upon (for example, can be edited).
    * when a file is cloned, this property will be set to `false`.

## Macros
* Macros are written in the `D:/Macros` directory
* each line in a macro file is a command that will be executed
* to add an alias to a macro, the **first line must** be `![alias]`. You can add only one alias per macro.
* to use file arguments inside of a macro, use `$[file argument number]` (ex. `$1`)

## Settings Directory
If you edit the `Settings:` drive directly, some settings won't apply until you reload the froggyOS state. An easy way to do this would be to run the `reload` macro.

## Trusting Programs
To trust a program, you must add its file name in the `D:/trusted_programs` file. This will allow the program to have extended control over the operating system. This must be done **manually** and cannot be done through a program.

## froggyOS Structured Data Storage (fSDS)
fSDS is a way to store key-value pairs in a file. A value can be one of four types: `String`, `Number`, or `Array`. fSDS is most prominently used to store file data in the `Config:/program_data` directory, but may be used in other places as well. You cannot store arrays inside of arrays.
### Non-Array
```
KEY [key name] TYPE [type (String/Number)] VALUE [value] END

KEY name TYPE String VALUE Alice END
KEY age TYPE Number VALUE 25 END
```
### Array
```
KEY [key name] TYPE Array START
0 TYPE [type (String/Number)] VALUE [value]
1 TYPE [type (String/Number)] VALUE [value]
(...)
KEY [key name] TYPE Array END

KEY favoriteColors TYPE Array START
0 TYPE String VALUE Blue
1 TYPE String VALUE Green
2 TYPE String VALUE Red
KEY favoriteColors TYPE Array END
```

## User file
The user file is located at `Config:/user`. It holds user-specific settings. Here is the default file contents, written in fSDS format:
```
KEY language TYPE String VALUE eng END
KEY colorPalette TYPE String VALUE standard END
KEY version TYPE String VALUE 1.17-indev END
KEY showSpinner TYPE Boolean VALUE false END
KEY currentSpinner TYPE String VALUE default END
KEY defaultSpinner TYPE String VALUE default END
KEY timeFormat TYPE String VALUE w. y/mn/d h:m:s END
KEY updateStatBar TYPE Boolean VALUE true END
KEY allowedProgramDirectories TYPE Array START
0 TYPE String VALUE D:/Programs
KEY allowedProgramDirectories TYPE Array END
KEY dissallowSubdirectoriesIn TYPE Array START
0 TYPE String VALUE D:/Programs
1 TYPE String VALUE D:/Macros
2 TYPE String VALUE D:/Program-Data
3 TYPE String VALUE D:/Palettes
4 TYPE String VALUE D:/Spinners
KEY dissallowSubdirectoriesIn TYPE Array END
KEY validateLanguageOnStartup TYPE Boolean VALUE true END
```

# Technical Information
## Startup Sequence
1. Load any state if it exists from `localStorage`
2. Get the user config from `Config:/user`
3. Set the program list
4. Update date and time
5. Change the color palette
6. Create the color palette bar
7. Set trusted files    
8. Validate current language
Along with the startup sequence, there are two intervals, `configInterval` and `dateTimeInterval`. The `configInterval` updates the user config and program list every 250 milliseconds, while the `dateTimeInterval` updates the date and time every 100 milliseconds.
