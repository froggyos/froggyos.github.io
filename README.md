froggyOS is an operating system simulation written entirely in the browser with JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. It is meant to be used as an educational tool to familiarize people with CLI based operating systems, rather than GUI based operating systems like Windows.

# FAQ
## Why is froggyos.xyz classified as 'unsecure' by my browser?
Because in order to connect to the Pond server, it has to make requests to my own HTTPS server, which is signed by Let's Encrypt, which SHOULD make your browser trust it, but it doesn't. Do not worry though, because I do not collect any data other than what is stated when you register for a Pond account.
