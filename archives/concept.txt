1. statement
2. oneliner
3. function

statement: a line that has a keyword
oneliner: a term that is being acted on by a method
function: a key that has multiple statements and/or oneliners associated with it

1. read the file line by line
2. for each line, check if it is a statement, oneliner, or function
3. depending on which it is, act accordingly
