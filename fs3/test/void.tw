Ever since the [color 255 60 60]/fire/[resetcolor], I've been[newline]
missing a part of me. It's[newline]
like there's a hole inside of me.[newline]
One could say, there's a "[invert]void[invert]".[linebreak]
[sleep 800]a void sounds like "avoid", which is[newline]
how /they/ treated me after the fact,[newline]
saying I caused the fire. I didn't. I swear.

Or did I? I don't remember.[linebreak]
I can't remember. I don't remember /how/ to remember.[newline]
