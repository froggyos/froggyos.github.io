[sleep][sleep]After a long day's work, I finally return to my home. My desk.[newline]
The machine stares at me. Blankly. I boot it up.[newline]
I have been working on a certain program for a while now.[newline]
As the machine boots up, I look around my room. There is a spider in the corner. I'd have to catch it later.[newline]
It makes that familiar sound, the sound it always makes when it turns on. I run my program.[linebreak]

The number "6" prints to the screen. All is well. I run my program again.[newline]
"66".[sleep] As it should. This is expected.[newline]
I run it again. "666". Wonderful.[newline]
Again. "6[speed4],[speeddefault]666". Excellent.[newline]
/Again./ "66[speed4],[speeddefault]666". /Perfect/.[newline]
*/Again!/* "666[speed4],[speeddefault]666".[linebreak]

[sleep].[sleep].[sleep].[linebreak]

[sleep]No.[sleep] This is wrong. I run it again.[linebreak]

[speed1]6,666,666[speeddefault][linebreak]

No. It is still wrong. Why? Why is it wrong? Did I make a mistake?[newline]
I run it a final time.[linebreak]

[speed1]66,666,666[speeddefault][linebreak]

[sleep][sleep]It is correct.[linebreak]

I had forgotten. It is always wrong those two times. Why? Why was I worried?[newline]
I sigh, close the program, and shut down the machine.[newline]
I see the spider. It's still in the corner. Why? Why is it still there? I should have caught it earlier.[newline]
I catch it in a red cup, and I bring it outside and release it, let it wander free.[newline]
I return into my room, and sit at my desk. The machine is off.[linebreak][sleep][sleep]

"Carrot"[linebreak][sleep][sleep]

That word echoes through my mind. I do not know why. I am scared. Confused.[linebreak]

I look at the machine. It is off. It is silent.[linebreak]

The day passes, and night falls. I am tired. I go to bed.[linebreak]

As I stare into the darkness of my room, I see a faint light coming from the direction of my desk.[linebreak]

I get up, and I walk to it. The machine is on.[linebreak]

The screen glows a faint white, from where it says:[linebreak]

[sleep][speed2]"What is your favorite vegetable?"[speeddefault][linebreak][sleep][sleep][typewriter-complete]
