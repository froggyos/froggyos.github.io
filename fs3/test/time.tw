[sleep 1400]Black, gold, silver.[sleep 700] The five eyes stare back at you.[linebreak]

Interlocking. Spinning. Revolving. It runs around the track of Time.[linebreak]

Click. Click. Click. Click. It clicks like the clock[speed 25][linebreak]

[speeddefault]that hangs in the basement of your grandparents' house.[linebreak]

[speed 75]Those long summer nights all those years ago.[speeddefault][linebreak][sleep 2100]

Spinning independently.[sleep 700] Without restriction.[sleep 700] It spins around the wheel[speed 25][linebreak]

[speeddefault]of Time. As Time flows, it clicks slower until it comes to[speed 25][linebreak]

[speeddefault]a halt. The main wheel stops.[sleep 700] But the six continue[linebreak]

Until it is stopped by you.[sleep 700] You who keep it on your desk.[linebreak]

You keep it on your desk. You keep Time on your desk.[linebreak]

Like the hourglasses of antiquity.[sleep 700] Unlike hourglasses, it keeps minutes, not hours.[linebreak]

But that minute of revolution is far more fulfilling than watching falling sand.[linebreak][newline]

The six on the outside. The two on the inside. The inside is governed[speed 25][linebreak]

[speeddefault]by the wheel of Time. But the wheel of Time is governed by you.[linebreak][sleep 1400][function]
